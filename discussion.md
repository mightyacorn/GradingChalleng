# Discussion Response

What instructions will we need to properly interact with your code?

1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Start the react native server with `yarn start`

Were there any decision points you came across? Did you need to make any assumptions?

- I think the directions and everything that needed to be done was pretty straight forward. I had to decided on some styling things but other than that everything was just done by following directions.

Were there any questions you would have asked if this was a real-world scenario?

- I would have asked some questions about some things that I know how to do in React, but not sure how I would do it in React Native.

How did you prioritize your time? If given a few more hours to improve this, what you would work on next and why?

- I spent roughly 2 hours total working on this. Since I have never worked with React Native I spent a little bit of time trying to figure out what was going on in the code, and then from there I split the remaining time roughly 50/50 for the design and the Take button functionality.

If you have any feedback or reflections, please share them with us. For example, if you could redo these exercises, what would you have done differently?

- For the take button functionality, I have the pressable button set to change to a green color on press, but I'm not sure how to make that green color stay in React Native. This also goes for being able to "uncheck" the take button. I'm almost 100 percent positive I know how to do this in React, but since I have never working in React Native, I would need some more time to figure this out. If I were to have re done the excersise I think I would have spent a little less time on styling the page and more time on the functionality so that I would have been able to achieve all the functionality that I would have like to achieve.
